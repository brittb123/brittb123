## About Me:

I am a game programmer that enjoys doing multiple projects in Unreal Engine along with Unity projects! My favorite programming is to do 
Artificial Intellegence or gameplay mechanics! The latest projec I worked on was a game called Althea. The game is about a sprite traveling
around the forest collecting gems! The player bloomed flowers when near the flowers.

## Projects:

#### Althea
[Itch.io Page](https://green-production.itch.io/althea)

- A game about a sprite traveling through the forest while collecting gems. The flowers bloom once the player is near the flowers. My main part 
of the projectwas working with User Interface. I had to make the menus easy to navigate and highlight when hovered by game pad.

- Old retro arcade survival game with upgrades and waves of enemies! I made the power ups that stop after a certain amount of time used. I also 
  made the player movement with limits to prevent going off screen!
